# Zomi Youth Development Site WordPress Theme
This hereby shall be the repository that houses the development of the custom WordPress theme for the Zomi Youth Development site.

I created a repository prior to this to begin coding the site from complete scratch. I've changed course a bit by deciding to continue using the WordPress framework but build a custom theme on top of it. This repository stores and tracks the development of the custom WordPress theme.

## Progress Update
It has been about a week since I started this project (I pushed my repo to GitHub much later). Here are two things on my mind so far:

    * Learning PHP is fun and being able to apply it to this project has made me very happy!
    * Bugs. There were lots of them. Some minor syntax error (like the infamous forgetting to type semicolon), while others are logical error (or logical roadblock) and are quite tough to solve.
