# Zomi Youth Development Site WordPress Theme
This hereby shall be the repository that houses the development of the custom WordPress theme for the Zomi Youth Development site.

I created a repository prior to this to begin coding the site from complete scratch. I've changed course a bit by deciding to continue using the WordPress framework but build a custom theme on top of it. This repository stores and tracks the development of the custom WordPress theme.

In /themes folder, you will notice two themes. The YD custome theme is the one that has the prefix 'yd'. I've included the default 'twentytwentytwo' WordPress theme so the site will have a default to fall back on to if the custom theme were to break.
